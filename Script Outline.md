   – someone knocks at her door but noone is visible from the doorspy
   - If alone:
   - switches to “don’t" in bold, 
   - get the choice to open the door,
   - if yes then you see noone and she gets freaked out (person x located her home)
   - if no then she just returns still freaked out  (Person x didn't locate her home)
   - goes to sleep unsettled
   - if with gabriel:
   - destiny is busy in the kitchen 
   - gabriel goes to check and sees noone through the door
   - he decides to open the door to check if anyone is there but sees noone and goes back inside (Person x didn't locate her home)

### Day 3:  
- Dream 3: The girl tells her she has to be careful. he's really nice and persuasive and she has to watch out not to fall for his tricks like she did
   - If gabriel was there she gets a bit suspicious of him 
   - if she was alone she gets confused and theorises who she means/ is scred
- Make the right call 
   - she realizes she has to make a call and gets to decide between gabriel and the police if she was alone
   - If she was with gabe she decides to call gabe 
   - if she was alone and calls gabe he offers to be around more
   - if she calls the police she finds out about the missing person near her
- Restart
   - once she gets to the office she starts talking with simon about the work she should be doing and the office space she gets for it. He tells her she can have kai's old place and should make herself at home. she finds some ominous notes tucked away
- Ignorance is bliss (was)
   - Matthew brings up that kai has gone missing. that they dont have much information so they are asking around the office if anyone knows anything
- Hands up everyone
   - there is a "party" at the office and everyone chats. someone makes a toast and if she called the police she gets a call from the police. that they saw a suspicious individual roaming around her appartment building.
- Where is waldo?
   - if she opened the door and did not call the police the cat has gone missing. showing someone was in her appartment
