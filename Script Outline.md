(home screen, a couple apps, no notifications waits a little) 
(gets a message from Gabriel (Omw! Hope you didn’t overseep again ;)), ) 
Destiny(t): Oh shoot! I gotta find something to wear. 
(destiny looks around, window, corridor back to kitchen/messy) 
Destiny(t): Jeez I really have to clean this up soon. When did I even wear that shirt? God even my desk is filled. Actually, I don’t think I've ever seen that screen of Achievements over there before. WAIT. ACHEIVMENTS!?

Narrator(Loud knocking): *Knock knock* 
Destiny: AH! 
(cup falls and shatters and spills) 
(shattered mug) 
Gabriel: Is everything alright in there? 

(Corridor) 
Gabriel: I’m sorry. Did I startle you? 
Destiny: No, no. It’s fine! One second. 
Destiny(t): Oh god this shirt is ruined. That sweater will have to do. 
(Short black wipe) 
(opens door, Gabriel enters) 
Gabriel: Are you sure you’re alright? 
Destiny: Oh, shut it. You almost scared me to death. 

(Kitchen) 
Destiny: Please just ignore the mess. I’m working on it I promise. Oh and don’t bother with the mug I’ll clean it up later too. 
Gabriel: Oh no not the chipmunk mug. I really liked that one. I think your mom gave you that right? 
Destiny: Mhm. Must’ve been easter or something like that. 
Destiny(t): Shoot! What am I going to wear now? 
Narrator: Destiny starts rummaging through her room 
Gabriel: I’ll just take care of these shards if that’s allright. 
Destiny: Yes! Found it! Give me a second to throw this on. 
(blackspace) 
Gabriel: No worries, I’ll do it. Our bus leaves in 20 minutes. 
Destiny: I’ll be quick 

(Bathroom) 
(Destiny in the mirror, dishevelled) 
(Blushes) 
Destiny(t): Let’s see how this fits 
(destiny smiles) 
Destiny(t): Jeez its worse than I thought. Better tidy this mess of a haircut up a bit. I have to find a brush. ! That screen seriously followed me here? Stain... Creepy. How the hell did It know that? That text was there before I even spilled my mug. Oh no I’m going insane. 
I really should have slept longer. This can’t just be me imagining things right? But it’s right, I don’t think that’s gonna come out. 
Gabriel: Destiny! Where’s the bin? I can’t find it anywhere.
