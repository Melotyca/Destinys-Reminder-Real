   - he decides to open the door to check if anyone is there but sees noone and goes back inside (Person x didn't locate her home)

### Day 3:

Destiny(t): Oh shoot! I gotta find something to wear.  
(destiny looks around, window, corridor back to kitchen/messy).

Destiny(t): Jeez I really have to clean this up soon. When did I even wear that shirt? God even my desk is filled. Actually, I don’t think I've ever seen that screen of Achievements over there before. WAIT. ACHEIVMENTS!?

Gabriel: Is everything alright in there?   

(Corridor). 
Gabriel: I’m sorry. Did I startle you?  
Destiny: No, no. It’s fine! One second.  
Destiny(t): Oh god this shirt is ruined. That sweater will have to do.  
(Short black wipe). 
(opens door, Gabriel enters). 
Gabriel: Are you sure you’re alright?  
Destiny: Oh, shut it. You almost scared me to death.   

(Kitchen). 
Destiny: Please just ignore the mess. I’m working on it I promise. Oh and don’t bother with the mug I’ll clean it up later too.  
Gabriel: Oh no not the chipmunk mug. I really liked that one. I think your mom gave you that right?  
Destiny: Mhm. Must’ve been easter or something like that.  
Destiny(t): Shoot! What am I going to wear now?  
Narrator: Destiny starts rummaging through her room. 
Gabriel: I’ll just take care of these shards if that’s allright.  
Destiny: Yes! Found it! Give me a second to throw this on.  
(blackspace). 
Gabriel: No worries, I’ll do it. Our bus leaves in 20 minutes.  
Destiny: I’ll be quick.  

(Bathroom). 
(Destiny in the mirror, dishevelled). 
Destiny(t): Let’s see how this fits. 
(destiny smiles). 
Destiny(t): Jeez its worse than I thought. Better tidy this mess of a haircut up a bit. I have to find a brush. ! That screen seriously followed me here? Stain... Creepy. How the hell did It know that? That text was there before I even spilled my mug. Oh no I’m going insane.  
I really should have slept longer. This can’t just be me imagining things right? But it’s right, I don’t think that’s gonna come out.  
Gabriel: Destiny! Where’s the bin? I can’t find it anywhere.  
Destiny(t): Shit! I have to hurry.  
Destiny: Be there in a second!  

(Kitchen). 
Gabriel: Ready to go?  
Destiny: Yes! Sorry for the wait.  
Gabriel: No worries. We've got enough time. Besides we've got a long enough day ahead of us. Do you think you'll get done with your design today?  
Destiny(t): Oh right. I'm supposed to finish the design for that ad poser this week.  
Destiny: Hah.. we'll see. Something's just not right about it yet but I can't figure out what. And Matt just gave that preach at the last meeting about being stricter with deadlines from now on. Im screwed.  
Gabriel: Don't be too hard on yourself Destiny. You've always found a way to get things done till now.  
Destiny: Yeah like a day past the due date.
