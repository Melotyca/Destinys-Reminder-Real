### Day 2: Planning with achievements, one unsettling achievement, finish project, run to print it, get stalked 
- Dream 2:
   - same girl telling her she's being watched and that she didnt want to leave but that she can help her now
   - destiny gets a bit more concerned about it this time since it was the same voice as last time but whenever she wakes up she cant quite remember who it was and starts forgetting what she even said throughout the day
- Stick the landing
   - finishes her project has to print it and bring to post 
   - decides she can just print the application if she hasnt already
- We meet again old foe
   – has to print again either successful or not depending on if you fixed it or not 
   - if yes she runs into Matt (foe) on the way out and gets caught up in a conversation about the girl that just quit but gets saved by gabriel and invites him over for dinner since she saw the achievement.
   - if not then she has to get person Xs help to fix the printer that's still broken (foe) doesn't invite gabriel
- Running, my new hobby! 
   - Has to run after the dog that has her prints (get to name the dog yayyy) 
- Dinner for two 
   - Either dog or gabriel(and the dog but he doesnt count in this case lmao) dependign on what you did with the printer 
- Knock knock/Don’t let him in (glitchy) 
   – someone knocks at her door but noone is visible from the doorspy
   - If alone:
   - switches to “don’t" in bold, 
   - get the choice to open the door,
   - if yes then you see noone and she gets freaked out (person x located her home)
   - if no then she just returns still freaked out  (Person x didn't locate her home)
   - goes to sleep unsettled
   - if with gabriel:
   - destiny is busy in the kitchen 
   - gabriel goes to check and sees noone through the door
   - he decides to open the door to check if anyone is there but sees noone and goes back inside (Person x didn't locate her home)

### Day 3:  
- Dream 3: The girl tells her she has to be careful. he's really nice and persuasive and she has to watch out not to fall for his tricks like she did
   - If gabriel was there she gets a bit suspicious of him 
   - if she was alone she gets confused and theorises who she means
- Make the right call 
-
